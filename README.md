# Launch-Page-AB-Test
I performed an A/B test for an e-commerce website to help the company understand whether or not they should implement their new webpage. 
Moreover, I ran a logistic regression to confirm the results obtained using the A/B test.
Finally, I communicate the results of the test and my recommendation for the company.
